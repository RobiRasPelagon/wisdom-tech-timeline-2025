# How to Contribute to Wisdom Tech Timeline 2025

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this mission. This is more than a project; it is a collaborative effort to build a future in harmony with Nature. Every contribution, no matter how small, is a step towards a more conscious civilization.

## Guiding Principles for All Contributors

Before you contribute, please align with our core philosophy. We are guided by one authority: **Nature**.

1.  **Harmony over Control:** We create technologies that work *with* natural principles, not against them.
2.  **Abundance over Scarcity:** We believe in and design for the natural abundance that the Earth provides.
3.  **Ethics First:** Every line of code, every design, and every decision must be filtered through our ethical framework: "Does this serve the well-being of all conscious beings and the planet?"
4.  **Openness and Transparency:** All our work is open for everyone to see, use, and improve upon. Knowledge is a shared resource.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to be a part of this mission, even if you are not a coder.

### 1. Share Your Ideas and Wisdom
- Join the conversation in the **`Discussions`** tab. Share your insights, research, or inspiration related to nature-aligned technologies, materials, and consciousness.

### 2. Improve the Documentation
- If you find a typo, a clarification that can be made, or a new resource to add, feel free to edit our documentation files (like this one, or the `README.md`).

### 3. Contribute Code or Technical Designs
If you are a developer, engineer, or designer, this is how you can help build the technical foundation.

**Step-by-step process:**

1.  **Find a task:** Look for open issues in the **`Issues`** tab, especially those labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
2.  **Claim the issue:** Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it.
3.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
4.  **Create a new branch:** Name your branch something descriptive (e.g., `feature/add-ethics-module` or `fix/readme-typo`).
5.  **Make your changes:** Write your code, create your design, or update the documentation.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Once you are ready, submit a Pull Request from your branch to our `main` branch. Please provide a clear description of the changes you have made.

Your PR will be reviewed by one of the maintainers to ensure it aligns with our project's goals and ethical principles.

## 4. Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to treat each other with respect, kindness, and open-mindedness. We are building a community, not just a project. Please be mindful of your words and actions.
